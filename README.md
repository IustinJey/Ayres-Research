# Ayres-Research | YOLO Object Recognition

I have trained a model to recognize cars and car number plates. The training was on a tiny data set. (Dataset in "Data" directory)

These are the results, we can definitely get better results using a large dataset.

On the other hand, I have used "yolov8" pre-trained model to process a video, and we achieved far better results.
